## The last step

after successfully running `npm run build:dist`, and you have the `dist` folder ready, YOU MUST do these easy steps:
- go to the images folder of the **src** directory  `/src/images`, and copy three items:-  **clients directory, small_logo_ar.png, and small_logo_en.png**
- Now go to  the images folder of the **dist** directory `/dist/images`, and paste the three items there.


Now you `dist` folder is ready to deploy.
